# Promise example

An application that exemplifies the use of Promise

## How it works?

I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run the server and JavaScript ES6.

## First steps

### 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### 2. Once Node.js installed, open up the terminal.

### 3. Navigate to the project folder:

```
$ cd promise-example
```

### 4. And finally run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You'll have access to the app at `localhost:8080`

## File structure

The basic file structure for the project is organized in the following way:

```
.
|-- images
|-- src
|-- dist
```
